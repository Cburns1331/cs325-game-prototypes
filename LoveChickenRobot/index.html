<h2>Love Chicken Robot</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a robot man, shooting hearts, at flying chickens.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The camera moves along with the character as he hits the side of the screen, arrow keys and mouse are implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned a lot about not knowing anything in JS/Phaser and that it's hard to make a good game on the time limit we are given with a full course load.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? Hardest part is changing your idea because I ran into issues and didn't have enough time to debug to make the original idea work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Grass Background: <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/t/green-grass-background-nature-above-details-71571395.jpg">Grass background</a></li>
<li>Chicken: <a href="http://piq.codeus.net/static/media/userpics/piq_352818_400x400.png">Chicken</a></li>
<li>Song: <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/tag/banjo/">Song</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Probably tanks because of the moving map, but I took inspiration from a few different sources. I used code from tanks and invaders game to set up parts of my game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Waves of chickens spawn, you are a robot man that shoots hearts from his eyes, how fast can you take on the waves and reach 50,000 points?
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken is the only true one, I took the love part of the love letter and robot man from the man secretly a robot.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse/Keyboard input. Deterministic Randomness. Competitor/Achiever Play Style. Shooter Genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The map movement along with locking camera for certain things while the map moves. I also wanted to learn about collision and weapons.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Quick and fun, shoot some chickens.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move your character, an initial wave spawns, and every 17 seconds after that another wave spawns, kill all of the chickens to win the game.It was intended for the chickens to blow up on death, which does work up until a certain point, but I have it disabled for now. I also planned on making it so the chickens would move and shoot back at the player at random, which would add a much higher level of difficulty for staying alive.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I think players who move in a particular pattern and shoot in a spread out manner will find success in this game. Spreading the bullets as much as possible seems to be the best bet.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A world where a robot man is the only non-chicken being left alive, and the chickens are trying to take over, will he be able to stop their uprising by gunning them all down?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Someone who is into shooting games/likes playing incomplete games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The minimum time to play is like 3 minutes, but it depends on the playstyle or when the player gets bored.
</li>
