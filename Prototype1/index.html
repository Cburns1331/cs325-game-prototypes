<h2>Rock Golf</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Combines rocks with golf! Ever want to be a golfer and geologist? This is for you!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Your ball can disappear! Watch out!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to change background, add music, add a sprite, scale a sprite, etc.
Not having something like Eclipse for JS. Would make life much easier.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music from: https://www.soundjay.com/free-music-1.html
Golfball from: http://hddfhm.com/images/free-golf-ball-clipart-20.png
Background from: https://opengameart.org/
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I got my idea from the cards the professor chose, combined them for learning purposes. Didn't copy anything or anyone.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Swing the ball around on your rocky surface while listening to some cool music.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Golf, Rocks/Geology.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The music has nothing to do with either, I was just feeling the vibe.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
It works with the physics in arcade mode, I hope to learn more about other versions of Phaser physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Chill out, listen to the music and move your mouse around.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move your mouse around the screen or off the screen to your hearts content.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
More accurate the mouse movements, the better they will be.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a world where the terrain is all rocks and the only thing that isn't covered in rock dust is golf balls, swing 'em around and have fun!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who has a mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
However long your attention span lasts.
